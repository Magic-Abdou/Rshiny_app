# Rshiny_app

I am currently working on developping a python version of an R package Rmixmod. This projet was a quick help for a colleague who is preparing a PhD in sport.
 I was asked to developp an application that could plot time series graphics related to a specific type of dataset he gets from athlete performance. You can find the rmd file and app.R file for shiny app.
